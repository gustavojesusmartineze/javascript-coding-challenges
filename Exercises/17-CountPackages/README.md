## Introduction
Package companies ðŸ“¦ are preparing for the holidays and the shipping madness that awaits them.

The company works with fleets of vans ðŸš› and trucks ðŸšš. Fleets have an organization chart, as there are ranges of experience level.

We need to know the number of packages that a person will be able to manage in a day. To do this, the number of packages that person can carry and **all the carriers that he has in his team are counted**. The bad thing is that the data is stored in a strange way in an array:

The array contains other arrays that contain the data of each carrier

`carrier[0]` -> Carrier Name/ID
`carrier[1]` -> Packages handled in one day
`carrier[2]` -> Array with its subordinates

### Examples

So that we can see it in code, both the array and the two-parameter function to get the desired number:

```
const carriers = [
  ['dapelu', 5, ['midu', 'jelowing']],
  ['midu', 2, []],
  ['jelowing', 2, []]
]

countPackages(carriers, 'dapelu') // 9
// 5 from dapelu, 2 from midu and 2 from jelowing = 9

const carriers2 = [
  ['lolivier', 8, ['camila', 'jesuspoleo']],
  ['camila', 5, ['sergiomartinez', 'conchaasensio']],
  ['jesuspoleo', 4, []],
  ['sergiomartinez', 4, []],
  ['conchaasensio', 3, ['facundocapua', 'faviola']],
  ['facundocapua', 2, []],
  ['faviola', 1, []]
]

countPackages(carriers2, 'camila') // 15
// 5 from camila, 4 from sergiomartinez, 3 from conchaasensio, 2 from facundocapua and 1 from faviola = 15
```

### Important
**Be careful!** As you have seen in the second example, **the organization chart can have different levels and we also get information that we may not need.** We must take into account the `carrierID` parameter to correctly calculate the number and count all your equipment.
