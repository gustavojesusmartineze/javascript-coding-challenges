## Introduction
With the excitement, we are already starting to count the calendar days until December 25 ðŸ“†.

To help with this, we are going to create a function that, by passing an instance of Date, tells us the number of days left.

Let's see some examples:

### Examples

```
const date1 = new Date('Dec 1, 2021')
daysToXmas(date1) // 24

const date2 = new Date('Dec 24, 2021 00:00:01')
daysToXmas(date2) // 1

const date3 = new Date('Dec 24, 2021 23:59:59')
daysToXmas(date3) // 1

const date4 = new Date("December 20, 2021 03:24:00")
daysToXmas(date4) // 5
```

The result has to be **an integer** and, as you can see, even if there is a second to go until the next day, it is understood that there is still a day to go.

**But beware!** It is also necessary to indicate if the date is the same day (we would return `0`) or if it is a future date (we would return the number of days in negative `-`):

```
const date = new Date('Dec 25, 2021')
daysToXmas(date) // 0

const date1 = new Date('Dec 26, 2021')
daysToXmas(date1) // -1

const date2 = new Date('Dec 31, 2021')
daysToXmas(date2) // -6

const date3 = new Date('Jan 1, 2022 00:00:01')
daysToXmas(date3) // -7

const date4 = new Date('Jan 1, 2022 23:59:59')
daysToXmas(date4) // -7
```

### Important
By the way, the reference date to know if it is December 25 is `Dec 25, 2021`.
