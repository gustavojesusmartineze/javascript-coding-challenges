## Introduction

IS IT AN ANAGRAM?
Statement publication date: 01/03/22
Resolution publication date: 01/10/22
Difficulty: MEDIUM

Statement: Write a function that receives two words (String) and returns true or false (Boolean) depending on whether or not they are anagrams.

- An Anagram consists of forming a word by rearranging ALL the letters of another initial word.
- It is NOT necessary to check that both words exist.
- Two exactly the same words are not an anagram.

### Examples

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "alf", t = "alf"
Output: false
```
